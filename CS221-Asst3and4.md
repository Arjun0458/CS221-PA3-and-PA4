This was the 3rd and 4th assignment of CS221. In this assignment PNG images were represented as quadtree data structures and we were tasked with completing the functions in quadtree.cpp. I wrote code for the following functions:

empty constructor
destructor
overloaded assignment operator
getPixel
decomprss
clockwiseRotate
prune
pruneSize
